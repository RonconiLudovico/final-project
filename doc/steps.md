### Here I will lis all the necessary steps in order to build the program

## The program will run simple functions:
 1. show object (uses recursion)
 2. Adding new object
 3. Modify existing object
 4. Delete existing object


- [x] First we need to build a JSON file in which to store all the necessary variables and dict to store our datas (literal object and dict to store)

- [x] Create a function which will convert Json files into usable python objects

- [x] Then we need to create utils files for each function we want to implement in the project (no func implementation yet)

- [x] Write basic structures for utils and main implementing each one with 'pass'

- [ ] Start implementing tests for each function, ending with main

- [ ] Implement the utils functions

- [ ] Implement main function with multiple choice menu
