### Here I will lis all the necessary steps in order to build the program

## The program will run simple functions:
 1. show object (uses recursion)
 2. Adding new object
 3. Modify existing object
 4. Delete existing object


- [x] First we need to build a JSON file in which to store all the necessary variables and dict to store our datas (literal object and dict to store)

- [x] Create a function which will convert Json files into usable python objects

- [x] Then we need to create utils files for each function we want to implement in the project (no func implementation yet)

- [x] Write basic structures for utils and main implementing each one with 'pass'

- [x] Start implementing tests for each function, ending with main

- [x] Implement the utils functions

- [x] Implement main function with multiple choice menu

- [x] Remove 'print' statement in 'add_object'

- [x] Remove 'print' statement from 'del_object'

- [x] check bug in 'edit object' function due to deletion process

- [x] fix objname in 'add_obj' final prompt

- [x] add final prompt to 'edit' function

- [ ] add menus for each choice
